				<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography at Penn State interested in geographies
					of education, neighborhoods, and the politics of boundary delineation. My dissertation research
					examines the redistricting school attendance zone boundaries (AZBs). In particular, I am interested
					in how redistricting criteria are interpreted, negotiated, and operationalized by different actors
					and the implications for power, agency, and educational justice. I earned my MS in Geography
					from Penn State in 2022. Prior to grad school at Penn State, I received my BA in Geography from
					Macalester College with a minor in Data Science. I then spent two years as a geographer at the
					<a href="https://mggg.org/">MGGG Redistricting Lab</a>, studying computational approaches
					to US redistricting.
